#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The file does the following:
 
- Loads all files and creates 1 main file
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
